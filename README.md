### # Citibike

In this imaginary scenario, our data team at Citibike is asked to assist in a lawsuit. A neighborhood group is lobbying to have some of the charging stations in their area removed. They claim that the space can be put to better use.
The case is not in court yet, so the right data can help support Citibike’s argument that the stations are being utilized and provide value to the neighborhood.
If successful, the case can be settled out of court and save the company a lot of \$\$\$.

This is the outline of the data team’s initial approach to the challenge:

1. **Find the key data points for the charging stations:**

   * Users: new users & returning users
   * Usage: How long are the bikes used each month, and on what days & times?
   * Geographical location of charging stations: What other transportation options are in the area, and how far away are they?

2. **Compare this to the same information for all Citibikes:**

   * Identify the highest-performing charging stations in the dataset. “Best” meaning most used.
   * Identify the lowest-performing charging stations.
   * Show where the charging stations under threat of removal fall between the highest and lowest performers.

3. **Create an internal presentation that:**

   * Makes a data-driven case proving the stations are used and provide value
   * Advises the negotiating team on which charging stations to keep and which ones to sacrifice if the case cannot be won

The team will present a clear, concise presentation with visuals that can be reviewed in less than 60 seconds.
